# HL7 Evidence Boundary

**Feature**: `013-hjra-hl7-stream-alignment`  
**Date**: 2026-03-10

## Purpose

Freeze what is actually confirmed for the HL7 lane before continuing profile
development. This note separates tracker-backed scope, vendor-manual evidence,
current code behavior, and synthetic test scaffolding.

## Tracker-Backed Facts

Source:
[OpenELIS Global Analyzer Integration Tracker](https://uwdigi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/mdgoe/pages/1097531396/OpenELIS+Global+Analyzer+Integration+Tracker)

- `Mindray BC-5380` is in scope as `A2 (HL7)` under `OGC-327`.
- `Mindray BS-series (incl. BS-200)` is in scope as `A2 (HL7)` under `OGC-326`.
- `HL7 MLLP Listener Service` is shared infrastructure under `OGC-325`.
- The tracker rates both BC-5380 and BS-series as `HIGH` confidence from vendor
  documentation.
- The tracker also states that real HL7 captures are still pending for both
  Mindray families.
- The BS-series note is explicit that the adapter must not hardcode `MSH-4`
  sender allowlists and should match dynamically through analyzer registration.

## Vendor-Manual Evidence

Source:
[BS-200 Host Interface Manual (v1.2)](https://pdfcoffee.com/bs-200-host-interface-manual-v12-pdf-free.html)

- The BS-200 family manual describes HL7 `v2.3.1` over TCP/IP with `MLLP`.
- The manual separates sender identity as:
  - `MSH-3`: manufacturer
  - `MSH-4`: model
- The manual examples use one test result per `ORU^R01` message for the
  BS-200/220/120/130/180 family.
- The manual examples use simple numeric test identifiers in `OBX-3`, not the
  copied `^^^CODE^NAME` structure used by several current synthetic fixtures.

## Current Implementation Facts

Current matcher behavior is defined in:

- `plugins/analyzers/GenericHL7/src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/plugins/analyzer/generichl7/GenericHL7Analyzer.java`
- `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/analyzer/service/AnalyzerServiceImpl.java`

Current reality:

- `GenericHL7Analyzer` extracts only `MSH-3`.
- `AnalyzerService.findByIdentifierPatternMatch(...)` evaluates one regex
  against one input string.
- The current matcher does not consider `MSH-4`.
- Profile and fixture success currently depends on synthetic messages that make
  `MSH-3` carry enough analyzer identity to match the configured regex.

## Header-Based Analyzer Identification (Bridge Mitigation)

The bridge infrastructure provides a tiered identification strategy that
mitigates the MSH-3 identity ambiguity documented above. This operates
independently of the GenericHL7 plugin's MSH-3 pattern matching.

### Tiered Strategy (HL7AnalyzerReader.identifyAnalyzerFromHeaders)

1. **IP+Port exact match** (highest priority): Bridge sends `X-Source-Id` (IP)
   and `X-Source-Port` headers extracted from the original TCP connection.
   `AnalyzerService.getByIpAddressAndPort()` performs a deterministic DB lookup.
2. **IP-only match**: If IP+port fails, falls back to
   `AnalyzerService.getByIpAddress()` for IP-only lookup.
3. **GenericHL7 plugin MSH-3 fallback**: If no headers are present or no DB
   match is found, the existing `GenericHL7Analyzer.isTargetAnalyzer()` MSH-3
   pattern matching runs as the final fallback.

### Integration Path

- `AnalyzerImportController.setBridgeHeaders()` (lines 203-227) extracts
  `X-Source-Id` and `X-Source-Port` from the HTTP request and injects them into
  `HL7AnalyzerReader`.
- `HL7AnalyzerReader.insertAnalyzerData()` calls `identifyAnalyzerFromHeaders()`
  before plugin matching. If a header-based match is found, its ID is injected
  into the plugin's `AnalyzerLineInserter` via `setContextAnalyzerId()`.
- `AnalyzerLineInserter.persistImport()` ensures `contextAnalyzerId` always
  takes precedence over plugin-assigned IDs, guaranteeing that the physical
  device identified by headers is the recorded source.

### Implication for MSH-3 Ambiguity

When the bridge is in the path (the standard deployment), the header-based
strategy provides deterministic analyzer identification even when multiple
Mindray models share the same `MSH-3` value (`MINDRAY`). The MSH-3 pattern
matching becomes a fallback for non-bridge deployments or unregistered
analyzers. This does not eliminate the MSH-3 gap but provides a practical
mitigation for the bridge-mediated topology.

## Profile Field Disambiguation: msh3_pattern vs identifier_pattern

Both BS-200 and BS-300 profiles contain two pattern fields:

- `msh3_pattern: "MINDRAY"` — Matches the MSH-3 sending application field. This
  is a coarse match that would match any Mindray analyzer.
- `identifier_pattern: "MINDRAY.*BS.?200|BS200"` (or `BS.?300|BS300`) — A
  model-specific regex intended for the
  `AnalyzerService.findByIdentifierPatternMatch()` path.

**Which is authoritative?** The `identifier_pattern` is the model-specific
discriminator used by `AnalyzerService` for registration and DB-backed matching.
The `msh3_pattern` reflects the observed MSH-3 value from vendor documentation
and is used by GenericHL7's `isTargetAnalyzer()` for runtime message matching.

**Why both exist:** The profile schema serves dual purposes — it seeds analyzer
registration (where `identifier_pattern` drives DB pattern matching) and
documents the expected HL7 message shape (where `msh3_pattern` reflects what the
device actually sends in MSH-3).

**Mitigation:** In bridge-mediated deployments, the header-based identification
strategy (documented above) resolves the analyzer before MSH-3 matching runs.
The `msh3_pattern` ambiguity only manifests in non-bridge or fallback scenarios.

## What Is Confirmed Vs Synthetic

### Confirmed

- HL7 is the correct protocol lane for the in-scope Mindray analyzers.
- `OGC-325` remains the shared prerequisite for the lane.
- BC-5380 should remain the first proving slice before BS-series expansion.

### Synthetic But Currently Useful

- Existing HL7 fixtures that force model identity into `MSH-3`.
- Existing profile regexes that assume model-specific matching can be derived
  from `MSH-3` alone.
- Multi-OBX chemistry fixtures for BS-series analyzers that are useful for
  parser tests but are not confirmed to reflect real device emission.

### Not Yet Proven

- That BS-series analyzers can be safely distinguished by `MSH-3` alone.
- That BS-300 truly shares the same effective sender identity and result shape
  as BS-200 in OpenELIS.
- That the existing BC-5380 seed profile matches real production message
  identity without adjustment.
- That header-based identification (bridge `X-Source-Id` / `X-Source-Port`)
  reliably resolves Mindray models in production deployments with multiple
  same-manufacturer analyzers on the same network.

## Current Profile Confidence

### `projects/analyzer-profiles/hl7/mindray-bc5380.json`

- Status: seed profile, lane-valid, message-identity details not fully validated
- Safe use: reference analyzer for matcher and parser regression tests
- Risk: its current `identifier_pattern` still assumes `MSH-3` contains enough
  model detail

### `projects/analyzer-profiles/hl7/mindray-bs360e.json`

- Status: seed profile only
- Safe use: structural template for chemistry profile shape
- Risk: must not be treated as evidence for BS-200 or BS-300 behavior

### `projects/analyzer-profiles/hl7/mindray-bs200.json`

- Status: active strict-013 profile used by the profile-backed mock adapter
- Risk: still synthetic relative to real-device captures; transport and matcher
  behavior are validated via harness proof but vendor capture parity remains
  open

### `projects/analyzer-profiles/hl7/mindray-bs300.json`

- Status: active strict-013 profile used by the profile-backed mock adapter
- Risk: BS-300 equivalence to BS-200 remains a validation question outside
  synthetic harness evidence until real captures are available

## Test-Connection Boundary

### Confirmed

- HL7 test-connection was a hardcoded stub returning `success: true` — fixed by
  `fix/013-hl7-test-connection` (PR #3195).
- All TCP analyzers now receive genuine connectivity testing: bridge health via
  `/actuator/health` + TCP connect to analyzer IP:port.
- CommunicationMode (ANALYZER_INITIATED, LIS_INITIATED, BOTH) contextualizes the
  test-connection response. TCP failure for ANALYZER_INITIATED is reported but
  bridge health is the primary success criterion.
- Bridge is mandatory architecture — OE never connects directly to analyzers.
- Mock server now listens on HL7 analyzer ports (5380, 6001, 6002) with proper
  MLLP framing and responds with HL7 ACK — matching real analyzer behavior.
  Previously the mock only pushed MLLP outbound; inbound listening was missing
  (spec gap: the readiness gates required "mock a specific analyzer type" but
  didn't explicitly require inbound MLLP listening).

### Design Decision

- Test-connection verifies TCP reachability (SYN/ACK) and bridge health. It does
  NOT send protocol messages — the TCP connect to the analyzer port proves the
  mock is listening, which is sufficient for the test-connection use case.
- MVP = ANALYZER_INITIATED (one-way result transport). This is a deliberate
  phased approach, not a permanent limitation.
- LIS_INITIATED and BOTH are documented future capabilities per vendor specs
  (OGC-327 ORM^O01, OGC-326 QRY^Q02, OGC-336 QBP).
- Direct OE→analyzer socket code has been removed. The bridge is the single
  point of contact for all analyzer communication.

### Not Yet Proven

- Bridge `/actuator/health` with `show-details: never` may aggregate MLLP status
  with other indicators. MLLP-specific health status in production deployments
  needs validation.

## Required Remediation Before Continuing Profile Expansion

1. Define the canonical sender identity contract for GenericHL7.
2. Lock that contract with tests before changing more profiles.
3. Realign seed profiles and fixtures to the tested matcher contract.
4. Keep all synthetic fixtures explicitly labeled as synthetic until real HL7
   captures are available.

## Unblock Condition

Profile development is considered honestly unblocked only when analyzer matching
is explicitly defined, tested, and no longer depends on undocumented assumptions
about `MSH-3` carrying model identity for the BS-series.
