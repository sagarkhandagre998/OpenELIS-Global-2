## **5\. Business Rules**

1. **Box ID Management**

   - Must be unique.

   - Can be auto-generated or manually scanned.

   - Prefix configurable by admin.

2. **Sample Management**

   - Each sample ID can belong to only one active box at a time.

   - Duplicates not allowed.

   - Supports accession number or “.1” suffix sample IDs.

3. **Packing List Requirements**

   - Must be barcoded.

   - Must include service location and temperature designation.

   - Can be resent electronically across the interface.

   - Regeneration allowed up to 24 hours; recall allowed within 7 days.

4. **Send Workflow**

   - Warning modal before sending is mandatory.

   - Once sent, a packing list is generated and locked (except for allowed
     resends/regeneration).

5. **Receiving Workflow**

   - Sample must be reconciled via scan or manual check.

   - Non-conformity must be recorded if marked.

6. **FHIR Alignment**

   - Use `SupplyDelivery.status` for box state (in-progress, completed,
     abandoned, etc.).

   - Use `Specimen.container.type` for sample container classification.

   - Non-conformities can map to SNOMED CT codes as needed.

7. **Audit Logging**

   - All box creation, sample additions, send/receive events, and
     non-conformities must be timestamped with user ID.

## **6\. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance**: Box creation and scanning must respond within \<1 second.

- **Security**: User authentication required (integrates with OpenELIS user
  management).

- **Auditability**: Full history of box/sample events maintained for compliance.

- **Scalability**: System must support 10,000+ samples/day.
