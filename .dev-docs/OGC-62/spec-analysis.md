---

## Questions Answered During Analysis

1. **Priority Source**: Priority is derived from test type configuration in
   OpenELIS
2. **Patient Name Privacy**: Permission-based display with "View Patient Names"
   permission
3. **Shipment vs Box**: Box is primary entity (1:1, no multi-box shipments)
4. **Temperature Requirement**: Box-level constraint (all samples should match)
5. **Tracking Number**: Manual entry only (no carrier API integration)
6. **Received vs Delivered**: Standardized to "Received" with additional
   "Reconciled" state
7. **Reject Sample vs Non-conformity**: "Reject Sample" button triggers
   non-conformity recording (soft rejection)
8. **Box Capacity**: Enforced limit (prevents adding beyond capacity)
9. **Reconciled State**: Added to distinguish "box arrived" from "all samples
   checked in"
10. **Simulate Scan**: For testing and training without physical scanners

## Carbon Design System Compliance

**Status**: ✅ **APPEARS COMPLIANT**

Visual inspection of designs suggests:

- ✅ Carbon color tokens (grays, blues, status colors)
- ✅ Carbon typography (IBM Plex Sans)
- ✅ Carbon spacing scale
- ✅ Carbon components: DataTable, Modal, Button, TextInput, Dropdown, Checkbox,
  Tag, ProgressBar
- ✅ Carbon icons: package, truck, checkmark, warning, settings, barcode

**Recommendation**: Validate component library linkage during `/speckit.plan`

---

## Constitution Compliance

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**

All 8 constitution principles documented in spec:

- ✅ CR-001: Carbon Design System
- ✅ CR-002: React Intl internationalization
- ✅ CR-003: 5-layer architecture
- ✅ CR-004: Liquibase for database changes
- ✅ CR-005: FHIR R4 for external integration
- ✅ CR-006: Configuration-driven variation
- ✅ CR-007: RBAC and audit trail
- ✅ CR-008: Test coverage >70%

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Update spec.md with all design findings
2. ✅ Add new functional requirements (FR-042 to FR-053)
3. ✅ Add UI/UX requirements section
4. ✅ Expand Key Entities with design fields
5. ✅ Enhance edge cases and assumptions
6. ✅ Clarify terminology

### Before `/speckit.plan`

1. **Request Missing Design Screens** from design team:

   - List of 11 screens documented above (P1, P2, P3 priority)
   - Provide this analysis document as context

2. **Optional - Stakeholder Review**:
   - Review updated spec with product owner
   - Confirm priority derivation from test type is acceptable
   - Confirm permission-based patient name visibility meets compliance

### During `/speckit.plan`

1. Map all 53 functional requirements to architecture layers
2. Define database schema with Liquibase changesets
3. Identify integration points with OpenELIS order entry
4. Plan FHIR R4 SupplyDelivery resource mapping
5. Design test strategy for >70% coverage
6. Create task breakdown for implementation

### During Implementation

1. Request access to Figma component library for code snippets
2. Validate Carbon component usage matches designs
3. Implement missing modals as designs become available
4. Follow TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)

---

## Recommendation

**✅ PROCEED TO `/speckit.plan`**

The specification is now comprehensive and aligned with the approved designs.
While additional design screens are needed for complete implementation, the core
workflows are fully specified and ready for architectural planning.

The missing design screens (modals and admin pages) can be created in parallel
with planning or during implementation without blocking progress on the primary
workflows.
