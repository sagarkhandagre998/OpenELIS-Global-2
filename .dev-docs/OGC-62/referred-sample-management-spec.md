## 1. Executive Summary

The Referred Sample Container Management System enables laboratory staff to
build, track, and manage boxes of samples sent to reference laboratories. The
system provides end-to-end tracking from box creation through receiving and
reconciliation, with full audit trails and electronic manifest exchange
capabilities.

### Key Capabilities

- Box creation and sample manifest management
- **Unassigned tests tracking - ensures all referred samples are accounted for**
- Barcode scanning integration for samples and boxes
- Configurable label printing (box labels and packing lists)
- Electronic manifest exchange via FHIR and API
- Receipt workflow with discrepancy tracking
- Comprehensive dashboard and reporting
- Non-conformity recording with optional documentation

### Unassigned Tests Feature

A critical accountability feature that tracks all samples marked for referral
but not yet assigned to a shipment. This prevents samples from being forgotten
or lost in the referral process by:

- Displaying all unassigned referred samples in a dedicated dashboard tab
- Highlighting samples based on how long they've been unassigned (7-day and
  30-day thresholds)
- Providing quick actions to add samples to boxes, mark as lost, or cancel
  referrals
- Supporting bulk operations for efficient management
- Optional alerting for aging unassigned samples

**BR-001: Unique Box ID**

- Each Box ID must be unique across the entire system
- Box IDs can be auto-generated using configured prefix + sequential number
- Box IDs can be manually scanned (e.g., from pre-printed labels)
- If scanned Box ID already exists, system rejects and prompts for different ID

**BR-002: Box State Transitions**

- Boxes must progress through states in logical order (see state diagram)
- Cannot skip required states (e.g., cannot go from Draft directly to Sent)
- State transitions are logged with timestamp and user ID
- Only administrators can reverse state transitions

**BR-003: Box Editing Restrictions**

- Draft boxes: Fully editable
- Ready to Send boxes: Can edit samples and metadata, but state resets to Draft
  if samples changed
- Sent/In Transit boxes: Cannot edit samples (manifest locked), can only edit
  notes
- After Sent: Only administrators can edit
- Received/Closed boxes: Read-only except for notes/documentation

**BR-004: Box Deletion**

- Only Draft boxes can be deleted
- Deletion requires confirmation
- Deleted boxes are soft-deleted (marked inactive, audit trail retained)
- Box IDs from deleted boxes cannot be reused

**BR-005: Minimum Box Requirements**

- Box must have at least 1 sample to be marked as Ready to Send
- Box must have destination selected
- Box must have all required metadata fields filled

---

### 5.2 Sample Management Rules

**BR-006: Sample Uniqueness**

- Each sample can belong to only one active box at a time
- Active boxes are those in Draft, Ready to Send, Sent, or In Transit states
- If sample is in Received/Closed box, it can be added to a new box (re-referral
  scenario)
- System checks sample status before allowing addition to box

**BR-007: Sample Eligibility**

- Samples already marked for referral in OpenELIS can be added directly
- Non-referral samples require additional step:
  - Reason for referral must be provided
  - System automatically applies referral flag to sample
  - Referral destination set to box destination
- System validates that sample exists in OpenELIS before adding

**BR-008: Sample Metadata Requirements**

- Each sample must have:
  - Accession Number (required)
  - Test Type (required)
  - Collection Date (required)
  - Temperature/Storage Requirements (if applicable from order)
- Missing required fields prevent box from being marked Ready to Send

**BR-009: Sample Removal**

- Samples can be removed from boxes at any time before receipt is completed
- Sample removal logs user ID, timestamp, and reason (optional)
- If sample had referral flag set by this box, flag is not removed (referral
  intention remains)
- Removing sample from Ready to Send box reverts box to Draft state

**BR-010: Duplicate Prevention**

- Scanning same sample twice in same box is rejected with error message
- System performs real-time duplicate check on scan/add

---

### 5.3 Manifest & Documentation Rules

**BR-011: Manifest Generation**

- Manifest can be generated at any point after box creation
- Final manifest is locked when box is marked as Sent
- Manifest includes:

  - Complete sample list with all metadata
  - Barcode for box and optionally for each sample
  - Temperature and handling requirements
  - Sender signature line (for printed copy)

**BR-012: Manifest Versioning**

- Each manifest regeneration creates a new version
- Version number increments (v1, v2, v3...)
- All versions retained in system
- Current version always displayed by default
- Users can view previous versions in history

**BR-013: Manifest Regeneration Time Limits**

- Regeneration allowed freely within 24 hours of sending
- After 24 hours up to 7 days: Recall option (requires admin approval)
- After 7 days: No regeneration (contact support for special cases)
- Reasoning: Prevents confusion with multiple manifests in circulation

**BR-014: Electronic Manifest Exchange**

- Electronic manifest sent automatically when box marked as Sent
- Transmission method based on destination configuration:
  - FHIR: SupplyDelivery resource with status "in-progress"
  - API: JSON POST to configured endpoint
  - Email: PDF attachment to configured recipients
- Multiple transmission methods can be active simultaneously
- Failed transmissions are retried automatically (3 attempts)
- Users can manually retry after automatic attempts fail

**BR-015: Label Printing**

- Box labels can be printed multiple times (reprints allowed)
- Each print logged in audit trail

  1. Destination-specific template (if configured)
  2. Default template (if no destination-specific template)
- Label must include barcode that matches Box ID exactly

---

### 5.4 Receiving & Reconciliation Rules

- If sample already marked as received: Warning displayed but scan allowed (for
  verification)
- Sample status changes to Received only after successful validation

**BR-018: Receipt Completion Criteria**

  - All expected samples are accounted for (Received, Missing, Damaged, or
    Rejected)
  - Any non-conformities have been documented
- Partial receipts are allowed (box can be completed with missing samples)
- Completion requires confirmation with summary of discrepancies

**BR-019: Missing Sample Handling**

- Samples not received can be marked as Missing
- Missing status is permanent but can be updated to Received if sample arrives
  late
- Missing samples do not prevent completion of receiving workflow
- Missing samples are included in reconciliation reports

**BR-020: Non-Conformity Recording**

- Non-conformities can be recorded at any point during receiving
- Non-conformity does not automatically reject sample
- Sample with non-conformity is flagged but remains "optionally available for
  testing"
- Non-conformity flag integrates with existing OpenELIS non-conformity system
- Photos/documents uploaded with non-conformities are linked to sample record

**BR-021: Unexpected Sample Handling**

- Unexpected samples are logged in receiving record but not added to manifest

  - Received → SupplyDelivery.status = "completed"
  - Cancelled → SupplyDelivery.status = "abandoned"
- Specimen.container.type used for sample container classification
- Organization references used for sender and receiver facilities

**BR-026: Sample Referral Integration**

- Sample referral flag in OpenELIS synchronized with box inclusion
- Adding non-referral sample to box automatically sets referral flag in order
  entry
- Referral destination in order entry updated to match box destination

const handleScan = async (barcode) => {
  try {
    await addSampleToBox(barcode);
    setScanStatus("success");
    setScanMessage(`Sample ${barcode} added`);
    playSound("success");
    // Auto-clear after 2s
    setTimeout(() => setScanStatus(null), 2000);
  } catch (error) {
    setScanStatus("error");
    setScanMessage(error.message);
    playSound("error");
  }
};

// Visual feedback component
{
  scanStatus === "success" && <CheckmarkFilled className="scan-success-icon" />;

unassigned_samples_view (derived from sample + facility + shipping_box_sample)
```

**Key Relationships:**

- Sample can be in multiple boxes over time (historical tracking)
- Sample can have 0 or 1 lost_sample_log entry
- Sample can have 0 or 1 referral_cancellation_log entry
- Sample with referral_flag=true and not in active box appears in
  unassigned_samples_view
- Facility referenced by both box destination and sample referral destination
