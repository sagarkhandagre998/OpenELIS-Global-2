# Unassigned Tests Feature - Summary of Additions

**Document Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Feature:** Unassigned Referred Tests Tracking

---

## Overview

The Unassigned Tests feature adds a critical accountability mechanism to ensure
all samples marked for referral are tracked and accounted for. This prevents
samples from being forgotten or lost between the time they're marked for
referral and when they're actually shipped.

- Quick action to add sample directly to existing or new box
- Removes sample from unassigned list

**US-021C: Mark Unassigned Sample as Lost**

### 5. Data Model Extensions

**Sample Table Additions:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN referral_flag BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN referral_date TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN referral_destination_facility_id BIGINT NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN referral_reason TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN referral_cancelled_date TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN referral_cancelled_by BIGINT NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN referral_cancellation_reason TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN lost_flag BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN lost_date TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN lost_by BIGINT NULL;
ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN lost_reason TEXT NULL;
```

**New Tables:**

1. **lost_sample_log** - Tracks all samples marked as lost with full audit trail
2. **referral_cancellation_log** - Tracks all referral cancellations with
   reasons
3. **unassigned_alert_config** - Admin configuration for aging alerts
4. **unassigned_samples_view** - Database view for efficient querying

## Implementation Priority

Given the accountability focus of this feature, the recommended implementation
order is:

### Phase 1 (Core - High Priority)

1. Database schema changes to sample table
2. Unassigned tests view/query logic
3. Dashboard tab with basic table display
4. Add to box workflow
5. Basic search and filter

### Phase 2 (Critical Actions - High Priority)

6. Mark as lost workflow with confirmation
7. Cancel referral workflow
8. Visual aging indicators (color coding)
9. Action audit logging

### Phase 3 (Efficiency - Medium Priority)

10. Bulk selection and actions
11. Export functionality
12. Advanced filters
13. Lost sample and cancellation logs

### Phase 4 (Alerts - Lower Priority)

14. Aging alert configuration
15. Email notifications
16. Alert banner on dashboard

---

## Testing Considerations

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Sample appears in unassigned list** when referral flag set
2. **Sample disappears from unassigned list** when added to box
3. **Aging calculation correct** (current date - referral date)
4. **Color coding updates** based on aging thresholds
5. **Mark as lost** removes from unassigned, can't be undone
6. **Cancel referral** removes from all tracking, returns to normal workflow
7. **Bulk add to box** validates all samples have same destination
8. **Search and filters** work correctly across all columns
9. **Export** includes filtered results only
10. **Admin can reverse lost status** but regular users cannot

### Edge Cases

- Sample marked for referral but immediately added to box
- Sample in box, box cancelled, sample becomes unassigned again
- Bulk operation with samples for different destinations
- Lost sample later found (admin reversal workflow)
- Referral cancelled but sample needs to be referred again later
- User tries to add lost sample to box (should be prevented)

---
